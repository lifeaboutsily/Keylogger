# 🔐 Keylogger in Python – Cybersecurity Project

Welcome to my first cybersecurity project! This repository contains a simple keylogger built using Python. The goal of this project is purely educational — to understand how keyloggers work and to learn basic cybersecurity concepts, including how to defend against such attacks.

## 💡 Project Objective

The primary goal of this project is to:

- Learn the basics of **keylogging**
- Explore Python for **cybersecurity applications**
- Gain hands-on experience in **ethical hacking techniques**
- Understand potential vulnerabilities and how to protect against them

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- [`pynput`](https://pypi.org/project/pynput/) – for listening to keyboard input
- Basic file handling in Python

## 📁 Features

- Logs all keystrokes typed by the user
- Stores the keystrokes in a `.txt` log file
- Runs silently in the background (no window or console output)
- Lightweight and simple design
